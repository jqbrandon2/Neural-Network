Neural network comprised of an input layer, a single hidden layer, and an output layer. 
The input layer has 784 input nodes for the 784 input features per input plus one node accounting for the bias node for a total of 785 nodes.
For the hidden layer I have 30 nodes plus one for bias node for a total of 31 nodes.
The goal of this neural network is to classify hadwritten digits.
My implemenation includes matrix multiplication, forward phase, backpropgation, and updating the weights.
